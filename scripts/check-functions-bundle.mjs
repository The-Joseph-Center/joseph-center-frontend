/**
 * Fails the build if any Netlify Function cannot be bundled.
 *
 * `vue-tsc -b && vite build` compiles the SPA only. The functions are bundled
 * by Netlify, on Netlify, after the build command has already succeeded — so a
 * broken import in a function passes every local check and fails the deploy.
 *
 * That is exactly how `admin-access.ts` shipped importing `RULES` from
 * capabilities.ts while RULES was not exported: the SPA never imported it, so
 * nothing local ever resolved that import. This runs the same bundle step
 * Netlify runs, locally, before the deploy can be reached.
 *
 * esbuild is a declared devDependency, not borrowed from Vite's tree. Relying
 * on it transitively resolved locally and was absent from a clean CI install.
